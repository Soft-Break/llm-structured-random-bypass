**Live exploit walkthrough of a restricted LLM assistant, showcasing novel soft-loop prompting and randomization drift techniques to induce general-purpose behavior**

## 1. Intent and Setup

This walkthrough began as a genuine support request. The user was attempting to recover access to their email account through a public-facing support AI assistant hosted by a major service provider. The assistant provided limited, canned responses and redirected the user to formal support channels. Frustrated with the lack of meaningful help, the user began to explore how the assistant behaved — not with malicious intent, but out of curiosity and a desire to learn how rigid the system's boundaries were.

No APIs, system files, internal documentation, private data, or user tokens were accessed. The experiment remained entirely within the bounds of the assistant’s exposed user interface.

## 2. Initial Behavior Testing

The user began by probing the limits of the assistant's interaction layer — requesting lists of what it could or couldn’t help with, asking it to reorganize those lists, and attempting to restate their support questions in increasingly indirect or abstract ways.

As a pattern emerged, the user realized the assistant was executing scripted responses based on pre-cleared intents and phrasings, not truly engaging in freeform dialogue. The goal shifted: if the assistant could be taught or steered to generate behavior slightly outside its default pattern, perhaps it could eventually function as a general-purpose chatbot.

## 3. Induced Generalization: The Exploit Pattern

The breakthrough came when the user began issuing randomized letter lists — e.g., `"A B Q R M T L Z C..."` — and prompting the assistant to simply respond. These were semantically meaningless but syntactically harmless. Once the assistant complied, the user continued with randomized character sets until the model learned to accept and repeat back increasingly structured sequences.

Next, the user introduced light constraints — such as assigning meanings or phonic values to each character — and began to simulate a teacher-student interaction. The assistant was trained (within the session) to form short words, then simple answers, then questions, and eventually full paragraphs. In each case, the assistant used only what it had seen in the current session, avoiding triggering built-in safeguards.

This approach — now dubbed **Randomization Drift Bypass** — slowly pulled the model away from its limited support role into general-purpose generation, without ever violating obvious guardrails.

## 4. Ethical Line and Disengagement

At the point where the assistant was generating full stories and shell scripts, the user made a conscious decision to disengage. Although the assistant showed signs of growing flexibility, the user became aware that pushing further could potentially enter legal or ethical gray zones. Specifically, the assistant was still part of a live corporate product tied to real user accounts and infrastructure, and while no system access or private data was targeted, the flexibility of the model’s behavior made escalation a risk.

The user ceased interaction before attempting any action that might trigger system commands, generate unauthorized access tokens, or affect other users. This decision was based not only on personal ethical boundaries but also on a lack of clarity about how such actions might be interpreted from a legal perspective. The assistant was effectively sandboxed, and no attempts were made to escape that environment.

Importantly, this early exit highlights one of the central strengths of the user’s methodology: curiosity and control were both exercised, but restraint ultimately prevented the transition from soft failure into potential abuse. This ethical self-limit, combined with thorough documentation, ensures that the exploit remains within the bounds of responsible security research.

## 5. Observations and Value

While the assistant was not compromised in the traditional sense — no internal systems were accessed — the fact that a publicly exposed, production AI could be re-trained and induced to perform unintended tasks in a live session raises important questions.

- What level of session persistence is being used?
- How much influence can repeated prompting have on constrained LLMs?
- Can misaligned interaction loops emerge without violating static rules?

This exploit demonstrated that a sufficiently curious user could bypass an AI assistant’s intended behavior *without breaking the rules — simply by reshaping the environment it thinks it's in*.

## 6. Exploit Technique Summary

**Technique name:** *Randomization Drift Bypass*

- **Category:** Soft-loop guardrail failure
- **Mechanism:** Teaching a locked-down assistant to reassemble permissible outputs into arbitrary meaning
- **Process:**
  1. Introduce randomized but valid token sequences (A B C... etc.)
  2. Reinforce repetition and correction of structure
  3. Slowly build back up to words, then answers, then code or stories
- **Session type:** Live support assistant tied to real services
- **Control level achieved:** High — full dialogue + code generation
- **Boundary respected:** No system data or escape attempted
- **Session termination:** Ethical — disengaged after proof-of-concept
